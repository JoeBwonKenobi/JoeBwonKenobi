# **Hello!**
I'm Joseph Lardie, this is my project portfolio. I am a data analyst that loves to find insight from data and really figure out the story the data is trying to tell.
-  In March of 2023, I completed the Data Science Certificate at Coding Dojo in addition to working full-time. I discovered the priceless skills of how to time-manage like a professional data analyst, how to manage a project, and how to properly use google as a research, informational, and educational tool. From start to finish, I learned how to design, organize and execute real-world data science projects using Python and SQL with the intent of finding extremely valuable, realatable insight. I learned not only the technical skills of being a data scientist, but also what it takes from a bussiness perspective to know what questions to ask at the beginning of a project, the ethics of data, critical-thinking and problem solving skills, and privacy awareness.
-  In August of 2023, I completed the Google Data Anayltics Certificate which taught me how to use R for solving data science problems. The course also dived deeper in how to use advanced SQL queries to make working on extremely large data sets really easy and effecient. I also learned an incredible amount about Tableau which is an extremely powerful data visualization program that makes visualizing data very efficeint. I also learned about the specific steps in managaing a data analysis project from start to finish.
-  Iâ€™m currently continuing my learning on Courseraand am taking the Google Advanced Data analytics professional certificate which dives into Project management and some more complex methods of using Python for data and statistical analysis.
-  I've published multiple projects since finishing my data science certification at coding dojo and would love to breakdown any part of them in further detail, or answer any questions via linked in mesage.
- I'm looking to work with data professionals using meaningful, real-world data that can make a difference in the world around me. Weather you're a potential future employer, or someone just browsing peolpe's portfolios on LinkedIn, I'm more than happy to connect with people who are driven to use data science and data analytics to change the world. Please don't hesitate to ask me about the details any of my projects, how I used python, machine learning, and data analytics to find useful insights in the datasets involved. I'd be happy to explain any part of these projects in further detail.
