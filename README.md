# **Hello!**
I'm Joseph Lardie, this is my project portfolio. I am a data analyst that loves to find insight from data and really figure out the story the data is trying to tell.Iâ€™m currently working on a project that takes real sales data from a local floral shop to identify sales trends and predict future sales.
I'm also currently working on a project that takes real data from my Apex legends profile on Xbox involving my kill/death ratio to forecast predictions based on past statistics.
-  I've completed the Data Science Certificate at Coding Dojo while working full-time as well and discovered the priceless skills of how to time-manage like a professional, how to properly use google as a research tool and informational, educational tool, and how to design, organize and execute data science projects with the intent of finding extremely valuable, realatable insight.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning form two different Coursers courses as well, Google data analytics professional certificate and Google IT Automation with Python professional certificate. The data analytics professional certificatet dives deep into every aspect of analyzing data to discover insight and identify trends or patterns. It also dives deep into using both spreadsheets and SQL extremely effectively. The Google IT automation course has tought me how to use BASH, run extremely complex scripts on a terminal, construct advanced functions to automate real-world tasks and so much more.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any freelance projects involving meaningful, real-world data that can make a difference in the world around me. Weather you're a potential future employer, someone just browsing peolpe's portfolios on LinkeIn, I'm more than happy to connect with people who are driven to use data science and data analytics to change the world. Please don't hesitate to ask me about the details any of my projects, how I used python, machine learning, and data analytics to find useful insights in the datasets involved. I'd be happy to explain any part of these projects in further detail.
