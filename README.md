# **Hello!**
I'm Joseph Lardie, this is my project portfolio. I am a data analyst that loves to find insight from data and really figure out the story the data is trying to tell.
- In March 2023, I completed the Data Science Certificate at Coding Dojo while working full-time. This experience enhanced my skills in time management, project management, and effective research using Google. I learned to design, organize, and execute real-world data science projects using Python and SQL, focusing on deriving valuable insights. The program also deepened my understanding of business aspects, including project scoping, data ethics, critical thinking, and privacy awareness.

- In August 2023, I earned the Google Data Analytics Certificate, gaining proficiency in R, advanced SQL queries, and Tableau. This course emphasized efficient data handling and visualization techniques, and project management from start to finish.

- By September 2023, I completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, which involved creating data visualizations, applying statistical methods, and building regression and machine learning models. I also learned to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders and understood various roles within a data team.

- Since completing these certifications, I have published multiple projects and am eager to discuss them in detail. Whether you're a potential employer or a LinkedIn connection, feel free to reach out if you're interested in using data science and analytics to make a real-world impact. I'm happy to explain any aspect of my projects or my use of Python, machine learning, and data analytics.
- I'm looking to work with data professionals using meaningful, real-world data that can make a difference in the world around me. Weather you're a potential future employer, or someone just browsing peolpe's portfolios on LinkedIn, I'm more than happy to connect with people who are driven to use data science and data analytics to change the world. Please don't hesitate to ask me about the details any of my projects, how I used python, machine learning, and data analytics to find useful insights in the datasets involved. I'd be happy to explain any part of these projects in further detail.
