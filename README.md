- 🔭 I’m currently working on one project that takes real sales data from a local floral shop to predict future sales.
- 🔭 I'm also currently working on a project that takes real data from my Apex legends profile on Xbox involving my kill/death ratio to forecast predictions based on past statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning form two different Coursers courses as well, Google data analytics professional certificate and Google IT Automation with Python professional certificate
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any freelance projects involving meaningful, real-world data that can make a difference in the world around me.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help networking with people who want to hire someone like me for an entry-level data scientist or data analyst position.
- 💬 Ask me about the details any of my projects, how I used python and data analytics to find useful insights in the datasets that I used.
